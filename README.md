## About the project
During my last year of high school, I was exploring the world of website development.
So, I used high school assignments as an opportunity to create websites and practice my skills.

This was one of websites created during that time. It was a part of a project that required me to 
create a formula summary book. So, I created a game to help remember the formulas. I created my own assets
and art for the website.
